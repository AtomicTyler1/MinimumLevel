# Minimum Level for Among Us

Host Only mod!

Technically not just a minimum level mod, it also has maximum levels.
Just a warning that the maximum and minimum values cannot surpass 1000 if you use the custom UI.
The UI Uses no libraries and is completely raw, so go into the config if you need to disable it for the mod to work with other mods.

# What does it do?

This mod will automatically kick/ban anyone who doesn't fall in range of whatever config you set (Must be host!!).
You (as the host) do not need to fall in range of this level set but its recommended you do, because like... play with your own levels.

# Configuration

- Minimum Level: The minimum level someone has to be to join
- Maximum Level: The maximum level someone can be to join
- BanInsteadOfKick: Bans the player instead of kicking them
- CustomUiINGame: Adds a new section in the game settings to edit the config live.

Again, custom UI is experimental and may be buggy. Please disable it if you need to, it just means without another mod you cannot edit the config live (I think).
